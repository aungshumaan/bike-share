The data for the project can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share
There are four .csv files, of which I have used two: station.csv and trip.csv. To minimize the size of the data files, I  dropped unnecessary columns. cleaning.R describes how I get the smaller datasets which are sent to the shinyappio server.
